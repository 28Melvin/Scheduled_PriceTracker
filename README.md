This R Shiny App is very similar to the Price Tracker App that is also uploaded in this repository. 

Difference: User can only plot the prices of two apple products. The prices are extracted using Windows Task Scheduler and storing the prices in a remote database. 

The repository also includes a Description1.Rmd file - that is however only for learning purposes.
