# Scheduled_Price Tracker 

This is my second R Shiny project - The app is very similar to the one in the "Price Tracker" repository (also uploaded here on github).

Difference: User can only plot the prices of two apple products. The prices are extracted using Windows Task Scheduler and storing the prices in a remote database. 

The repository also includes a Description1.Rmd file - that is however only for learning purposes.
